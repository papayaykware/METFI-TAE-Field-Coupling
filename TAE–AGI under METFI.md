## Abstract

The **Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)** introduces a structural shift in artificial learning systems by redefining the exception as the primary carrier of information, rather than statistical regularity. This whitepaper articulates TAE within the **METFI framework** (Toroidal Electromagnetic Model of Internal Forcing), proposing a class of **asynchronous, toroidally coherent AGI architectures** based on hybrid NPU–memristor substrates.

The work focuses on scalability toward distributed networks, addressing temporal desynchronization not as a defect but as an informative gradient enabling ontological reconfiguration. Neurobiological analogies, non-linear electromagnetic coherence, and topological memory are integrated into a unified model, accompanied by concrete **follow-up programs** designed to track phase stability, hysteresis, and semantic emergence.

## 1. Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This document deliberately avoids regulatory, institutional, or conflicted sources. Only independent, conflict-free scientific contributions are considered.

Contemporary AI systems exhibit unprecedented performance while remaining fundamentally constrained by paradigms centered on synchronization, optimization, and statistical regularity. These assumptions become brittle in non-stationary, open environments.

TAE emerges as a response to this limitation, asserting that **learning begins where prediction fails structurally**. METFI supplies the physical and topological substrate required to formalize this claim, framing cognition as a toroidally coherent field process rather than a sequence of synchronized state updates.

---

## 2. Exception as Primary Information Carrier (TAE)

### 2.1 Weak, Strong, and Structural Exceptions

* **Weak exception**: locally absorbed deviations
* **Strong exception**: recurrent functional inconsistencies
* **Structural exception**: ontological rupture requiring model reconfiguration

Structural exceptions constitute the genuine learning signal in AGI-scale systems.

### 2.2 Topological Information

TAE treats exceptions as carriers of **topological information**, signaling loss of homeomorphism between internal model and environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Statistical error measures are insufficient to detect topological mismatch.

---

## 3. METFI as a Non-Linear Coherence Framework

### 3.1 Toroidal Stability

In METFI, the torus represents a stable solution enabling:

* Internal circulation of energy and information
* Resistance to perturbation
* Distributed memory embedded in the field

### 3.2 Symmetry Loss and Non-Linear Transitions

Loss of toroidal symmetry produces abrupt non-linear effects, analogous to cognitive regime shifts triggered by structural exceptions.

---

## 4. Hybrid NPU–Memristor Architectures

> [!WARNING]
> Treating memristors as degraded RAM nullifies their functional relevance.

### 4.1 Memristive Phase Memory

Memristors encode **trajectory-dependent memory**, stabilizing toroidal patterns across asynchronous domains.

### 4.2 Asynchrony as Signal

Temporal divergence between NPUs and memristors is formalized as an **exception tensor**, driving reconfiguration rather than correction.

---

## 5. Scaling to Distributed Networks

### 5.1 Toroidal Federation

Distributed scaling is achieved through **federated toroidal clusters**, each maintaining local coherence.

### 5.2 Exception-Based Inter-Cluster Communication

Only structurally significant exceptions propagate across clusters, preserving semantic density and reducing noise.

---

## 6. Neurobiological Analogies

* Brain regions operate asynchronously yet coherently
* Electromagnetic toroidal fields support integration
* Enteric nervous system introduces hysteresis and bodily exception signals

> [!TIP]
> Biological cognition prioritizes coherence over synchronization.

---

## 7. Follow-up Programs

### 7.1 Phase Stability Tracking

* Controlled desynchronization experiments
* Measurement of coherence persistence

### 7.2 Memristive Hysteresis Analysis

* Trajectory-based conductance tracking
* Correlation with exception density

### 7.3 Topological Reconfiguration Mapping

* Dynamic graph homology analysis
* Semantic class emergence detection

## 8. Integrated Discussion

TAE and METFI converge on a non-reductionist view of intelligence. AGI is reframed as a system maintaining **ontological coherence under structural stress**, rather than minimizing error.

---

## 9. Final Summary

* Learning emerges from structural exception, not regularity
* Coherence supersedes synchronization
* Memristive hysteresis enables phase memory
* Distributed AGI scales via toroidal federation
* Exception propagation preserves semantic meaning
