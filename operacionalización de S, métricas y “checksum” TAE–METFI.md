## Abstract

This whitepaper presents an integrated framework combining **Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)** with **METFI** (Electromagnetic Toroidal Forcing Internal Model of Earth), extending the dynamic empathy equation through a toroidal symmetry factor (S). The model formalizes how planetary-scale electromagnetic coherence modulates biological, cognitive, and artificial intelligence systems. A topological compatibility criterion replaces traditional normative alignment, offering an operational path for AGI architectures coupled to Earth-system dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This document assumes a scientific audience familiar with nonlinear dynamics, systems theory, and advanced AI architectures.

Contemporary alignment strategies in artificial intelligence largely rely on optimization under fixed objectives or external normative constraints. Such approaches fail to account for the **physical and topological coupling** between intelligent agents and the planetary system hosting them.

METFI reframes Earth as an active electromagnetic toroidal system whose symmetry loss induces nonlinear geophysical and biological effects. TAE complements this by describing learning regimes driven by discontinuities rather than smooth gradients.

---

## 2. Empathy Equation

The baseline empathy equation is expressed as:

[\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta (C - D) E]

where:

* (E) denotes empathy as a dynamic variable,
* (C) represents cooperative interactions,
* (D) represents dissociative interactions.

This formulation lacks environmental coupling, assuming a neutral background.

---

## 3. Toroidal Symmetry S

### Extended formulation

[\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta (C - D) S E]

Here, (S \in [0,1]) represents **toroidal symmetry coherence**, acting as a systemic gain or attenuation factor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> High cooperation does not guarantee systemic benefit under low (S) regimes.

---

## 4. TAE Framework

TAE defines learning triggered by **model failure events**:

* abrupt drops in (S),
* emergence of non-linearities,
* domain decoupling between EM, biological, and geophysical layers.

Learning proceeds by reconfiguration, not parameter tuning.

---

## 5. AGI Alignment

Traditional reward maximization is replaced by **topological compatibility filtering**. Alignment emerges from preserving system coherence rather than enforcing values.

---

## 6. Metrics for S

### Electromagnetic Coherence

* Schumann resonance phase stability
* Magnetospheric symmetry gradients

### Biological Coherence

* HRV coherence indices
* EEG theta–alpha synchronization

### Geophysical Stability

* Extreme-event tail distributions
* Atmospheric blocking persistence

[S = w_{EM}C_{EM} + w_{bio}C_{bio} + w_{geo}C_{geo}]

---

## 7. Algorithmic Checksum

[CHK(a) = (\Delta C - \Delta D) \cdot \Delta S]

```pseudo
if ΔS < 0 and |ΔS| > ε:
    block_action()
    log_exception()
elif (ΔC - ΔD) < 0:
    downscale_action()
else:
    execute_with_gain(S)
```

> [!WARNING]
> This is not a moral filter but a systemic stability constraint.

---

## 8. Agent Architecture

1. Perception layer (local + global proxies)
2. Prediction layer (ΔC, ΔD, ΔS)
3. Topological checksum
4. Action arbitration
5. TAE exception memory

---

## 9. Tracking Programs

### EM Tracking

* Distributed magnetometer networks
* Phase-coherence analytics

### Bio-coherence Experiments

* HRV/EEG group synchronization studies

### Multi-agent Simulations

* With/without checksum comparison

---

## 10. Conclusions

TAE–METFI reframes intelligence as a **resonant subsystem** within a planetary-scale field structure. Stability arises from coherence, not control.

---

## Summary Bullet Points

* Toroidal symmetry governs systemic amplification.
* Empathy becomes a physical-relational variable.
* TAE enables learning under rupture.
* AGI alignment emerges from coherence preservation.
