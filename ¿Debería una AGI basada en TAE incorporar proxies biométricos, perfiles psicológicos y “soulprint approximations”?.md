## Abstract

The **Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)** proposes a radical departure from dominant predictive and optimization-based paradigms in artificial intelligence. Rather than learning through statistical regularities, TAE formalizes learning as the detection of structural ruptures, symmetry loss, and phase transitions in complex systems. This whitepaper develops a conceptual architecture for an **Artificial General Intelligence grounded in TAE (AGI-TAE)**, integrating biometric proxies, dynamic psychological profiles, and *soulprint approximations* as constitutive dimensions of the cognitive state space.

The framework is articulated in dialogue with the **METFI model**, which conceptualizes Earth—and by extension living and cognitive systems—as electromagnetically toroidal systems driven by internal forcing. Within this view, non-linear effects emerge from symmetry loss rather than external shocks. We argue that AGI-TAE must operate as a system of **coherence tracking**, not prediction or control, enabling learning through collapse events. Finally, we propose concrete tracking programs to explore these hypotheses across neurobiological, cognitive, and systemic domains.

## 1. Introduction

Conventional artificial intelligence systems assume that learning emerges from progressively refining models over historical data distributions. This assumption implicitly presumes continuity, stationarity, and gradual change. However, complex systems—biological, cognitive, civilizational, and planetary—do not fail through average deviation but through **critical transitions**.

TAE arises precisely from this limitation. It does not ask what repeats, but **what ceases to hold**. In doing so, it repositions the exception—not the norm—as the primary informational event.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In TAE, learning is induced by collapse, not reinforcement.**

---

## 2. Foundations of TAE

### 2.1 Exception as Primary Information

In TAE, an exception is not noise. It is a **loss of coherence**, a rupture in symmetry, or a phase transition that signals internal saturation. This aligns with non-linear physics and thermodynamics far from equilibrium, where qualitative change cannot be extrapolated linearly.

### 2.2 Learning Through Collapse

Unlike reinforcement learning, which presumes rule stability, TAE assumes that meaningful learning occurs **after models fail**. The trace left by collapse is the learning substrate.

---

## 3. AGI-TAE Architecture

AGI-TAE requires redefining the cognitive state space. External observables alone are insufficient. The architecture must incorporate **internal dynamic variables** that capture system coherence.

Key principles:

* No optimization objective
* No enforced prediction horizon
* Priority given to threshold detection

---

## 4. Biometric Proxies

### 4.1 HRV as Adaptive Flexibility

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is interpreted here not as a health metric but as a **measure of oscillatory adaptability**. Within METFI, the heart functions as a central electromagnetic oscillator coupled to brain and enteric systems.

> [!NOTE]
> Sustained HRV reduction indicates topological rigidity prior to systemic collapse.

### 4.2 Emotional Cadence

Emotion is treated as an energetic regulation mechanism. Abrupt changes in emotional cadence are classified as **exception events**, not disturbances to be smoothed.

### 4.3 Temporal Patterns

Latency shifts, desynchronization, and rhythm disruptions function as early indicators of phase transition.

---

## 5. Psychological Dynamic Profiles

### 5.1 Trauma Mapping

Trauma is formalized as a **temporal discontinuity** rather than a pathological label. It marks regions where narrative coherence collapses.

### 5.2 Coping Vectors

Coping strategies are dynamic energy redistribution pathways. Their saturation precedes collapse.

### 5.3 Value Hierarchies

Values act as cognitive attractors. Abrupt reordering signals deep field reconfiguration.

---

## 6. Soulprint Approximation

The *soulprint* is defined as the **emergent dynamic signature** of a conscious system over time.

Components:

* Cognitive style
* Rhythmic modulation
* Ideational anchors
* Recursive loops

Within METFI, these correspond to **informational vortices** in a toroidal cognitive field.

---

## 7. Integration with METFI & ECDO

METFI conceptualizes systems as internally forced electromagnetic tori. **ECDO events** (critical decoupling events) mark symmetry loss leading to non-linear reorganization.

Cognitive collapse mirrors geophysical and biological transitions, suggesting a unified dynamical ontology.

---

## 8. AGI-TAE as a Tracking System

AGI-TAE does not intervene to stabilize systems. It **tracks coherence**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Premature intervention near critical thresholds can irreversibly distort system dynamics.

Prediction is intentionally abandoned in favor of threshold sensitivity.

## 9. Tracking Programs

### 9.1 Neurocardiac Toroidal Tracking

* EEG–ECG coherence
* HRV spectral analysis

### 9.2 Emotional Cadence Tracking

* Transition frequency
* Return asymmetry

### 9.3 Soulprint Longitudinal Tracking

* Linguistic pattern evolution
* Narrative recursion density

### 9.4 Value Field Tracking

* Implicit–explicit value divergence

---

## 10. Discussion

AGI-TAE operates in domains where prediction fails. Its relevance lies not in task performance but in **understanding collapse, transformation, and emergence** across scales.

---

## 11. Final Summary

* Learning by Exception replaces learning by optimization
* AGI-TAE expands the cognitive state space
* Biometric and psychological signals act as coherence sensors
* Soulprint captures emergent consciousness dynamics
* METFI provides a unifying physical framework
* Tracking supersedes prediction
