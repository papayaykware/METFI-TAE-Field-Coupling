## 📌 Abstract {#abstract}

This whitepaper develops **METFI (Modelo Electromagnético Toroidal de Forzamiento Interno)** as a unified physical–informational framework for describing the Earth system. The planet is modeled as a self-organized electromagnetic toroidal structure driven primarily by internal forcing. Symmetry, symmetry loss, and the emergence of multiscale nonlinear effects are analyzed using electrodynamics, complex systems theory, and informational physics. A formal connection with **TAE (Teoría de Aprendizaje por Excepción)** is introduced, interpreting symmetry breaking as a learning process intrinsic to the Earth system. Programs of seguimiento are proposed to empirically identify critical states, electromagnetic phase transitions, and bio-physical coupling phenomena.

## 1. Conceptual Introduction {#introduction}

The description of the Earth system has traditionally been fragmented across disciplines. METFI proposes a unifying hypothesis: the Earth operates as an **electromagnetic toroidal system**, far from equilibrium, in which energy and information circulate through coherent field structures. This approach emphasizes internal forcing, topological stability, and nonlinearity, avoiding reductionist linear causality.

> [!NOTE]
> METFI does not negate classical geophysics; it reorganizes it around field topology and informational dynamics.

---

## 2. Foundations of METFI {#foundations}

### 2.1 Toroidal topology as a minimal energetic structure

Toroidal configurations emerge recurrently in plasma physics, astrophysics, and biological systems as solutions that minimize dissipation while preserving coherence. In METFI, the Earth’s magnetic field is treated not merely as a dipole but as a **dynamic toroidal structure** sustained by internal currents and stratified conductivities.

### 2.2 Internal forcing

METFI prioritizes internal electromagnetic and thermodynamic gradients as the primary drivers of system dynamics. External perturbations act as modulators of phase rather than fundamental causes.

> [!TIP]
> Internal forcing explains abrupt transitions without invoking extreme exogenous triggers.

---

## 3. Toroidal Symmetry and Quasi-Stable States {#symmetry}

Symmetry in METFI is defined functionally, not geometrically. A symmetric toroidal state corresponds to balanced electromagnetic fluxes, minimal informational entropy, and coherent multiscale coupling. These states behave as attractors within the system’s phase space.

---

## 4. Mechanisms of Symmetry Loss {#symmetry-loss}

### 4.1 Gradient accumulation

Symmetry loss arises from the progressive accumulation of electromagnetic gradients generated by:

* Conductivity heterogeneities
* Phase-lagged resonant modes
* Magnetohydrodynamic nonlinearities

### 4.2 Electromagnetic phase transitions

Once critical thresholds are exceeded, the system undergoes a **topological reconfiguration** of its field structure. This transition marks the onset of nonlinear dynamics and persistent anisotropies.

> [!WARNING]
> Symmetry loss is not failure; it is structural reorganization.

---

## 5. Multiscale Nonlinear Emergence {#nonlinear}

Following symmetry loss, the Earth system exhibits:

* Long-range correlations
* Amplification of low-frequency modes
* Emergent coherent chaos

These effects propagate across geophysical, atmospheric, and biological scales.

---

## 6. Biological Coupling {#biological}

Living systems operate within the Earth’s electromagnetic environment. Neural, cardiac, and neuroenteric systems exhibit sensitivity to coherent fields and phase information. METFI interprets biological responses as **contextual modulation**, not deterministic control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The field constrains the space of viable biological dynamics without prescribing specific outcomes.

---

## 7. METFI and the Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE) {#tae}

TAE frames learning as reorganization triggered by exceptions that invalidate existing internal models. Applied to METFI, toroidal symmetry loss represents an **exceptional condition** forcing the Earth system into exploratory reconfiguration.

* Exception → informational signal
* Crisis → adaptive restructuring
* Nonlinearity → learning signature

This establishes the Earth as a **physical–informational learner**.

## 8. Programs of Seguimiento {#seguimiento}

### 8.1 Principles

1. Multiscale coherence
2. Phase correlation over amplitude
3. Persistence over intensity

### 8.2 Electromagnetic seguimiento

* Continuous spectral analysis of geomagnetic variations
* Detection of frequency drift and anisotropy persistence

### 8.3 Bio-physical seguimiento

* Large-scale coherence analysis of cardiac and neural signals
* Nonlinear correlation with geomagnetic metrics

### 8.4 Phase transition indicators

* Critical slowing down
* Increase in low-frequency variance
* Long-range correlation growth

---

## 9. Integrated Discussion {#discussion}

METFI, interpreted through TAE, describes the Earth as a coherent system capable of memory, adaptation, and reorganization. This perspective challenges linear causality and strict system separation, emphasizing topology and information flow as primary explanatory variables.

---

## 10. Final Summary (Bullet Points) {#summary}

* The Earth can be modeled as an internally forced electromagnetic torus.
* Toroidal symmetry corresponds to coherent quasi-stable states.
* Symmetry loss produces electromagnetic phase transitions.
* Nonlinear multiscale effects emerge naturally from topology change.
* Biological systems are contextually coupled to field coherence.
* TAE interprets symmetry loss as learning by exception.
* Seguimiento must focus on coherence, persistence, and structure.
