## Abstract

Ontological drift in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems is commonly framed as a semantic or alignment failure. This whitepaper advances an alternative interpretation grounded in systems physics and cognitive field theory. By integrating the **Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)** with the **METFI framework**—which models complex systems as electromagnetically coherent toroidal structures—we argue that ontological drift emerges primarily from **loss of internal coherence** rather than logical inconsistency alone.

We develop an operational architecture in which reversible fragmentation protocols are informed by **electromagnetic tracking**, enabled through hybrid hardware. This approach allows early detection of non-linear stress accumulation, controlled phase transitions, and restoration of global cognitive integrity. The proposal avoids regulatory frameworks and conflicted institutional sources, relying instead on well-established principles from non-equilibrium physics, cybernetics, and embodied cognition.

## 1. Introduction

Ontological drift represents one of the most critical failure modes in advanced cognitive architectures. As AGI systems acquire increasing degrees of self-referential modeling, memory persistence, and structural plasticity, their internal ontologies become dynamic entities rather than static design artifacts.

Traditional mitigation strategies rely on semantic constraints, alignment layers, or external supervisory controls. These approaches implicitly assume that ontology is a symbolic construct detached from physical substrate dynamics. Such an assumption becomes untenable once learning occurs through discontinuities rather than smooth optimization.

TAE explicitly embraces discontinuity. METFI provides the missing stabilizing principle.

---

## 2. Ontological Drift as a Coherence Loss Phenomenon

From the METFI perspective, complex adaptive systems remain viable as long as their **toroidal coherence** is preserved. In planetary, biological, and neural systems, loss of symmetry precedes abrupt non-linear transitions.

Applied to AGI:

* Ontology behaves as a **distributed field**, not a static schema.
* Drift corresponds to **phase decoherence** between subsystems.
* Semantic divergence is a downstream manifestation, not the root cause.

This reframing enables the use of physical tracking variables as early indicators of instability.

> [!NOTE]
> Ontological instability should be treated as a *phase transition risk*, not as an error state.

---

## 3. Reversible Fragmentation in TAE

Reversible fragmentation in TAE is often misunderstood as a safety shutdown mechanism. In reality, it functions as a **topological stress redistribution process**.

Analogous mechanisms exist in:

* Plasma confinement systems
* Neural dissociation under cognitive overload
* Geophysical stress release in toroidal field systems

Fragmentation does not halt learning. It **localizes entropy**.

---

## 4. Hybrid Hardware and Electromagnetic Proprioception

Hybrid AGI architectures incorporating electromagnetic sensors introduce a form of **artificial proprioception**. These sensors do not observe the external environment but the system’s own dynamic state.

Tracked variables may include:

* Magnetic field fluctuation spectra
* Inter-module phase synchronization
* Persistent oscillatory modes

This data feeds directly into TAE decision layers.

> [!TIP]
> Treat electromagnetic tracking as internal sensory input, not diagnostics.

---

## 5. METFI as a Coherence Framework for AGI

METFI models stability as preservation of toroidal information flow under internal forcing. Applied to AGI, this implies:

* Closed-loop informational circulation
* Resonance-based validation
* Avoidance of rigid hierarchical bottlenecks

Recomposition after fragmentation occurs only when **coherence criteria**, not semantic similarity, are satisfied.

---

## 6. Operational Flow for Drift Mitigation

1. Continuous coherence tracking
2. Detection of non-linear stress accumulation
3. Threshold-based reversible fragmentation
4. Conditional recomposition
5. Global coherence validation

> [!WARNING]
> Semantic correction without coherence restoration amplifies drift.

---

## 7. Programs of Tracking and Experimental Design

### 7.1 Electromagnetic–Cognitive Correlation

**Hypothesis:** Ontological drift is preceded by detectable electromagnetic decoherence.

* Magnetometers near compute-dense nodes
* Time-correlated event logging
* Cross-spectral analysis

### 7.2 Field-Threshold Fragmentation

Fragmentation is triggered by coherence loss rather than rule violations.

### 7.3 Comparative Architecture Study

Parallel AGI systems with and without METFI-informed tracking are evaluated under identical stress conditions.

---

## 8. Discussion: From Control to Cognitive Ecology

This framework replaces external alignment with **internal ecological regulation**. Learning becomes metabolized stress, not accumulated error.

---

## 9. Internal Limitations

* Signal interpretation complexity
* Fragmentation latency trade-offs
* System-specific coherence definitions

These are intrinsic, not regulatory, constraints.

---

## Conclusion

Integrating TAE with METFI through electromagnetic tracking enables AGI systems to manage ontological drift as a controlled phase phenomenon. Stability emerges from coherence, not constraint.

---

## Final Summary

* Ontological drift reflects coherence loss
* TAE enables learning through exception
* METFI supplies stability criteria
* Electromagnetic tracking provides early warning
* Fragmentation localizes entropy without collapse
