## Abstract

Artificial General Intelligence research has largely relied on homogeneous architectures optimized for continuous statistical learning. This assumption fails under conditions of semantic rupture, regime shifts, and non-linear discontinuities. In parallel, DARPA's HARQ program introduces a radically different paradigm in quantum computing: functional integration of physically heterogeneous technologies within a single coherent system.

This whitepaper formalizes the **Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)** as a foundational framework for AGI, proposing that true learning emerges through topological reconfiguration triggered by exception, rather than incremental optimization. Drawing from heterogeneous computing, neurobiological electromagnetic fields, bioinformatic genetics, and planetary-scale models such as METFI, the paper articulates AGI–TAE as a coherent, physically grounded and scalable architecture.

## 1. Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> Continuous optimization presupposes a smooth world. Intelligence does not.

Current AGI approaches scale parameters while preserving architectural uniformity. This strategy assumes continuity of the underlying problem space, an assumption repeatedly violated in real-world cognition. Exceptional events are not noise; they are structural signals.

---

## 2. Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE)

TAE posits that learning occurs when a system encounters an internal contradiction that cannot be locally resolved. Instead of gradient correction, the system performs **topological reconfiguration**.

Key properties:

* Non-continuous learning
* Episodic restructuring
* Energy-intensive transitions

---

## 3. Limits of Continuous Learning Architectures

Transformers and related architectures fail systematically under:

* Heavy-tailed events
* Ontological novelty
* Semantic inversion

Their limitation is not scale, but **structural rigidity**.

---

## 4. HARQ and Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HARQ demonstrates that coherence can emerge from heterogeneity.

DARPA HARQ integrates incompatible quantum technologies into a single functional system. This mirrors TAE principles: exceptions trigger cross-domain coupling rather than correction.

---

## 5. Convergence: AGI as a Heterogeneous System

An AGI–TAE system requires:

* Multiple representational regimes
* Asynchronous temporal dynamics
* Exception-driven orchestration

No single model dominates. Coherence is contextual.

---

## 6. Neurobiological Parallels

Human cognition relies on transient electromagnetic coherence across:

* Brain
* Heart
* Enteric nervous system

Learning correlates with episodic field synchronization, not continuous adaptation.

---

## 7. Bioinformatic and Genetic Architectures

Exosomes act as distributed information carriers enabling non-local genetic modulation. The organism behaves as a **distributed bioinformatic system** responding to global state changes.

---

## 8. METFI and Planetary-Scale Learning

METFI models Earth as an electromagnetic toroidal system. Loss of symmetry induces non-linear geophysical and biological effects, analogous to TAE-induced transitions.

Civilizational collapse can be interpreted as a planetary-scale learning exception.

---

## 9. AGI–TAE Architecture Principles

1. Structural heterogeneity
2. Meta-exception detection
3. Topological reconfiguration
4. Transient coupling
5. Memory of rupture

---

## 10. Programs of Follow-up

### Experimental Lines

* Detection of cognitive phase transitions
* Energy consumption during learning events
* Stability analysis post-exception
* Comparative HARQ–AGI simulations

> Reproducible notebooks are provided in `/notebooks/TAE_experiments.ipynb`

---

## 11. Discussion

> [!WARNING]
> Intelligence optimized for stability collapses under novelty.

AGI–TAE reframes intelligence as the capacity to remain coherent through rupture.

---

## 12. Final Summary (Bullet Points)

* Learning emerges from exception-induced reconfiguration
* Heterogeneity is a feature, not a flaw
* HARQ validates physical feasibility
* Biology confirms episodic learning
* METFI extends TAE to planetary systems
* AGI must manage rupture, not eliminate it
