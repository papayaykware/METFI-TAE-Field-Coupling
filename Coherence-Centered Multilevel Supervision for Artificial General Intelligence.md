# Abstract

This paper proposes a coherence-centered architecture for Artificial General Intelligence based on the Theory of Learning by Exception (TAE). The model is structured around three interdependent supervisory modules: logical (cortical), axiological (cardiac), and operational (enteric). Stability is defined not as logical consistency alone, but as dynamic synchronization across representational, value-based, and execution layers.

The framework introduces error-profile coupling, toroidal feedback topology, nonlinear stability constraints, and exception-triggered structural reorganization. Mathematical formalization and experimental monitoring programs are presented to support reproducibility and further development.

# 1. Introduction

AGI design traditionally focuses on generalization capacity and alignment mechanisms. However, these dimensions are often treated independently. This separation is structurally unstable.

In complex adaptive systems, collapse rarely results from isolated failure. It emerges from desynchronization across regulatory layers.

TAE reframes learning as structural reorganization triggered by exceptional incoherence. Within this perspective, AGI stability requires distributed supervision across differentiated domains.

---

# 2. Theoretical Foundations

## 2.1 Coherence as Emergent Stability

Coherence is defined as phase synchronization across system layers.

\[
\textbf{E}(t) = (E_L, E_A, E_O)
\]

Stability requires bounded vector norm:

\[
||\textbf{E}|| < \kappa
\]

---

## 2.2 Multilevel Error Typology

| Module | Error Type | Domain |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Cortical | Logical inconsistency | Representation |
| Cardiac | Value misalignment | Normative alignment |
| Enteric | Operational failure | Environmental interaction |

---

# 3. Triadic Architecture

> ⚙️ **Design Principle:** Stability emerges from distributed regulation, not centralized authority.

## 3.1 Logical Module (Cortical)

- Formal consistency verification  
- Inferential robustness  
- Semantic integrity  

\[
E_L = f(\text{contradictions}, \text{ambiguity}, \text{instability})
\]

---

## 3.2 Axiological Module (Cardiac)

- Goal-value alignment  
- Constraint verification  
- Long-horizon coherence  

\[
E_A = g(\text{goal deviation}, \text{ethical violation})
\]

---

## 3.3 Operational Module (Enteric)

- Environmental interaction  
- Execution safety  
- Contextual robustness  

\[
E_O = h(\text{execution error}, \text{unexpected impact})
\]

---

# 4. Toroidal Feedback Dynamics

> 🔁 **Topology Insight:** Regulation operates in closed-loop toroidal coupling.

\[
\frac{dE_L}{dt} = \alpha E_A + \beta E_O
\]
\[
\frac{dE_A}{dt} = \gamma E_L + \delta E_O
\]
\[
\frac{dE_O}{dt} = \mu E_L + \nu E_A
\]

Cross-coupling coefficients determine attractor stability.

---

# 5. Mathematical Formalization

## 5.1 Coherence Energy Function

\[
\mathcal{C} = w_L E_L^2 + w_A E_A^2 + w_O E_O^2 + \lambda E_L E_A + \eta E_L E_O + \rho E_A E_O
\]

If:

\[
\mathcal{C} > \mathcal{C}_\theta
\]

→ Exception protocol activation.

---

## 5.2 Lyapunov Stability Condition

\[
\frac{dV}{dt} < 0
\]

Ensures bounded trajectory within coherence basin.

---

# 6. Exception-Driven Reorganization (TAE)

> ⚡ **Core Mechanism:** Learning occurs via structural reconfiguration.

### Exception Types

- Parametric (absorptive)
- Structural (topological reconfiguration)

Structural exception modifies hypothesis space itself.

---

# 7. Collapse of Coherence

Defined as exponential divergence of error coupling:

\[
||\textbf{E}(t)|| \rightarrow \infty
\]

Practical manifestations:

- Hyper-instrumental rationality
- Value drift
- Operational instability

---

# 8. Neurodynamic Parallels

> 🧬 Functional analogy, not anthropomorphism.

- Cortical synchronization (Buzsáki 2006)
- Communication-through-coherence (Fries 2015)
- Enteric autonomy (Furness 2012)
- Heart-brain afferent regulation (McCraty 2009)

These illustrate distributed regulation in biological systems.

# 10. Technical Discussion

The AGI–TAE framework operates at a meta-architectural layer. It does not replace transformer-based systems or neural networks. It regulates them.

The primary contribution is structural:  
Coherence is elevated from secondary property to governing principle.

Without axiological coupling → instrumental drift.  
Without logical constraint → epistemic degradation.  
Without operational grounding → contextual failure.

Distributed supervision prevents nonlinear amplification of deviation.

---

# 11. Conclusions

AGI stability cannot rely solely on computational scale.  
It requires synchronized multilevel regulation.

The triadic architecture:

- Distributes supervision.
- Detects structural deviation.
- Activates topological reorganization.
- Maintains dynamic coherence basin.

Stability is not static equilibrium.  
It is continuous multilevel recalibration.
